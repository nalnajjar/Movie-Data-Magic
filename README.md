# Movie Data Magic

![Theater](static/images/theater.jpg)

We decided to take our data to the movies! This website will showcase cinematic data, award show insights, and use machine learning tools for revealing regressions and make predictions from poster images. Hopefully, exploring our final project , in a small way, help you enjoy cinema even while theaters are closed.
