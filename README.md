# Movie Data Magic

We decided to take our data to the movies! This website will showcase cinematic data, award show insights, and use machine learning tools for revealing regressions and make predictions from poster images. Hopefully, exploring our final project will, in a small way, help you live vicariously while theaters are closed.
